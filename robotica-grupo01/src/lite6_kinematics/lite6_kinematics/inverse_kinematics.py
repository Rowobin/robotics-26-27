"""Labwork 2 - inverse kinematics of the UFACTORY Lite 6 by Newton's method, as a ROS 2 node.

THIS IS THE ONLY FILE YOU EDIT IN LABWORK 2.

Implement the following, replacing every ``raise NotImplementedError``:

    Part B - the maths (no ROS needed)
        pose_error(T_c, T_d)               the 6-component error between two poses
        jacobian(q, h)                     the numerical 6x6 Jacobian
        inverse_kinematics(T_d, q_start, h)    Newton's method

    Part B - the node
        IkNode                             reads a desired pose, publishes the
                                           joint angles that reach it

Run the node with ``ros2 run lite6_kinematics ik_node``.

``rotation_vector``, ``transform_from_pose``, ``JOINT_LIMITS``, the constants
``H``, ``TOL_POS``, ``TOL_ORI``, ``MAX_ITER``, ``MAX_STEP`` and ``main`` below
are PROVIDED: already implemented, do not edit them.

Keep the function and class names, arguments and return types exactly as they
are: the checker node (``ik_check``), the study program (``ik_study``), the
tests in ``test/`` and the instructor's grader all use them by name.

Conventions - those of Labwork 1:

    * Frame {0} coincides with the ROS frame ``link_base``; frame {6} with
      ``link_eef``. The desired pose T_d is the pose of {6} in {0}.
    * Joint angles in RADIANS, as published on /joint_states.
    * Lengths in METRES.

Allowed imports: ``numpy`` and ``math`` for the maths, ``forward_kinematics``
from your own ``lite6_kinematics.forward_kinematics`` (already imported below),
and ``rclpy``, ``sensor_msgs`` and ``geometry_msgs`` for the node (already
imported below). Nothing else - no MoveIt, no kinematics library, no URDF
parser, no tf. The pose of the end-effector comes only from
``forward_kinematics()``. ``test/test_inverse_kinematics.py`` checks the imports.
